						First task! When you have a chance, familiarize yourself with the <a href="https://www.zakthebaker.com">Zak The Baker</a> website. <br>

				<ul>
					<li> 
						These resources are for employees that work for both the Deli and the Bakery locations
					</li>
					<li> 
						Bakery employees that are hired as "Drivers" or employees hired for <strong>night shifts</strong> will not require parking
					</li>
					<li> 
						Full Time employees are eligible for insurance after the <em>90-day probationary period</em>
					</li>
				</ul>
				Passing the 90-day probationary period means the employee is always:
				<ol>
					<li> On Time </li>
					<li> On task </li>
					<li> Communicates well with others and with their supervisors </li>
					<li> Delivers excellent customer service at all times </li>
				</ol>
				You will be subject to a 90-day performance review where you will be told where your strengths and weaknesses are, this review can decide whether your employment with the company continues or not.
